              Header elements are a container for introductory information and navigation links. They typically contain: <br>
              - One or more heading elements<br>
              - A logo or icon<br>
              - author information

              The Navigation element is a container for related links. Not every link should be in a Navigation element, however. They are only intended to contain major blocks of navigation links. Menu or Table Contents links are good examples of links that should be wrapped in a Navigation element. Navigation elements help search engines and screen readers understand layout of your website.

              The Main element is a container for the dominant content of the webpage, and using this element helps web browsers and screen readers identify the main content. The Main element should not contain any content that is repeated in other parts of the page like sidebars, navigation links, logos, copyright information, etc.

              Heading elements are containers for headings and sub-headings. They have preset text sizes, with h1 being the largest and h6 being the smallest. Heading elements also help the HTML Document Outline separate the webpage into sections. The size of the new heading element in relation to the previous one is what determines the outline as you go down the page. <br>
              - If the next heading element is large than the last, a new parent section is created in the outline.<br>
              - If the next heading element is the same size as the last, a new sibling section is created in the outline.<br>
              - If the next heading element is smaller than the last, a new child section is created in the outline.<br>
