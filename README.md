## General info
This project is a codecademy project. It was relatively free-form in that all you're given is the following parameters:
* Your project should document at least one HTML or CSS topic.
* Your site should use HTML tables to display the documentation. 
* Your site should utilize a custom color scheme.
* Your site should use custom styles for any code such as HTML tags (like &lt;h1&gt;) or CSS properties or values (like font-family).

From there it's up to you to use what you've learned about HTML and CSS to build a site that matches the design specs.
